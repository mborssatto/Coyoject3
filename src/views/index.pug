  p This project is a learning exercise, as part of my Course on Software Engineering at Coyotiv (2022). It is not a finished application and is deprecated once the learning goals have been achieved. This is why you wonâ€™t find any meaningful feature and why things may be breaking ;-)
  p I am surely learning loads though!
  p This time I'm learning automated testing.
  p This was built on top of Coyotiv's Express + Mongo starter Template.
